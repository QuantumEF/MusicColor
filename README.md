# MusicColor
 This is a method of converting sound into colors.
 It works by either giving a wave file to either MusicColor.py or MusicColorArduino.py to play a color sequence based on the loudest tone that is picked up in a small segment of audio.
 
 The Live version will take live mic sound and convert it to a color.
